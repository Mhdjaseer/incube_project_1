            <h2>"J BREWS CAFE"</h2>
            <P>‚ÄúEsthetic cafe with a variety of tasty foods! Hazelnut hot chocolate was my favourite. Ambience and lighting is the highlight -i havenot seen many cafe's with such beautiful lighting! Sit out was the best part. Adjoining the cafe is a posh clinic J smiles offering not just wide range of treatments in dentistry. But also hair and skin services. Quite a unique idea i must say! Absolutely loved it‚Äù</P>
